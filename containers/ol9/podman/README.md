# VirtualBox VM for Containers using Podman on Oracle Linux 9 (OL9)

I use a VirtualBox VM for playing around with container builds using Podman on Oracle Linux 9 (OL9). This represents the base of that VM.

## Required Software

* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

In addition you will need to download all the required Oracle software and put it into the "software" directory, so it can be copied into place and used during the builds.
